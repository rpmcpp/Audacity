# To build Audacity on Panther (10.3) while retaining Jaguar (10.2)
# compatibility, type these options into tcsh:

setenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.2
setenv NEXT_ROOT /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.2.7.sdk
setenv C_INCLUDE_PATH /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.2.7.sdk/usr/include
setenv LIBRARY_PATH /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.2.7.sdk/usr/lib/gcc/darwin/3.3

# Also recommended for good performance:

setenv LD_PREBIND 1

# Note that Audacity will also be compatible with 10.1 as long as
# lrint and lrintf are not called.
