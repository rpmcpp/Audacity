Audacity currently supports displaying MIDI files if you import
them using Import MIDI in the Project menu.
<br><p>

Audacity does not support playing, recording, or editing MIDI files.
It does not even support saving MIDI Tracks in a project file.
<br><p>

The current functionality is useful to only a small group of people who
are studying algorithms that relate MIDI data to audio data and simply
wish to see the visual representation of the MIDI data and how it lines
up with the audio data.
