The Time Track is a new feature that lets you change
the rate of playback over time.  Start by choosing
New Time Track from the <a href="menu_project.htm">Project Menu</a>.
Then change the range of time warping by clicking on the
<a href="menu_track.htm">Track Pop-Down Menu</a> and choosing
Set Range (an option which only appears for Time Tracks).
Older computers may be incapable of playing audio in real-time
that makes use of a Time Track, however you can always Export the
file as a WAV and then playback the WAV file later.
<br><p>

To edit the time warping, choose the envelope tool from the
<a href="toolbar_control.htm">Control Toolbar</a> - the same tool
you use to edit amplitude envelopes in Audio Tracks.  Click to
create and edit control points.  Drag points off-screen to
delete them.
<br><p>

The Time Track has a ruler.  As you edit the warping, the ruler will
warp to show you at what time playback will reach each place in the
audio.
