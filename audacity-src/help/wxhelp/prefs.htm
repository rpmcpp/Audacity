<h2>Audio I/O</h2>
</font>

<ul>
<li><b>Playback Device</b> - Use this control to select the device
    that will be used for playback / audio output.  This is usually
    only applicable if your computer has more than one sound card.
    <p></li>

<li><b>Recording Device</b> - Select the devce that will be used
    for recording / audio input.  Note that many devices have
    multiple <i>sources</i> such as Microphone and Line in - to
    select the input source you will need to use the 
    <a href="toolbar_mixer.htm">Mixer Toolbar</a>.<br><p>
    For finer control over audio I/O, open your system's Sound
    control panel or the control panel that came with your
    sound card.
    <p></li>
<li><b>Recording Channels</b> - Use this to select the number of
    channels to record simultaneously.  Select 1 for mono and
    2 for stereo.  Audacity will support recording more simultaneous
    channels, but note that most sound cards only support stereo, and
    even if your sound card supports more than 2 inputs, you need a
    fast computer and a large, fast hard disk to record many channels
    for a long time.<p>
    Mono recording is not the same on all computers or sound cards.
    Sometimes recording mono only records the left channel, and sometimes
    it mixes the left and right channels.
    <p></li>

<li><b>Play other tracks while recording new one</b> - 
    When this box is checked, Audacity will play existing tracks
    when you press record - otherwise it simply records the new
    track without letting you hear what you've already recorded.
    You can use this option to record harmonies with yourself or
    add a voiceover.
    <p>
    You may notice that when you play the two tracks you recorded
    together, they aren't synchronized.  This is unavoidable to a
    certain extent, though future versions of Audacity may try to
    minimize it even more.  To fix it, you will need to grab the
    <a href="toolbar_control.htm">Time Shift</a> tool and slide one
    of the tracks around until it sounds right.
    <p></li>
    <li><b>Hardware Playthrough</b> (Mac Only) - plays the audio you are
    recording straight back out to your headphones or speakers so you can
    hear it. This option is done in harware, so it is fast and doesn't
    consume resources. However, it is only possibly if input and output
    are on the same sound device.
    <br/>PC users can do the same thing in their volume control
    settings, turning up the relevant audio input.<p></li>
    <li><b>Software Playthrough</b> - Does the same thing as hardware
    playthrough, but in software. This means that the audio you hear may be
    slightly delayed relative to the input, and activating this option
    will use some more system resources. However, it works on all systems, 
    even if you are recording from one device and playing back through
    another.<p></li>
</ul>

<font color="#000099">
<h2>Quality</h2>
</font>

<ul>

<li><b>Default Sample Rate</b> - This controls the sample rate of new
    projects.  To change the sample rate of an existing project,
    use the control in the lower-left corner of the main project window.
    <p>

<li><b>Default Sample Format</b> - This controls the default format used
    to store audio samples.  16-bit takes up the least space and is
    equivalent to audio CD quality.  32-bit float takes up twice as
    much space but is much more flexible.
    <p>
    If you have a fast computer and enough disk space, you should always
    use 32-bit float samples while editing, and then export your final
    mix as a 16-bit WAV file (the default).
    <p>

<li><b>Real-time sample rate converter</b> - Audacity has more than one
    sample rate converter that's used when you have a track that's not
    the same sample rate as the project.  This option lets you set the
    converter used during real-time playback, which can be different than
    the one you use during Export or mixing.
    <p>

<li><b>High-quality sample rate converter</b> - Audacity has more than one
    sample rate converter that's used when you have a track that's not
    the same sample rate as the project.  This option lets you set the
    converter used during Export and mixing, which can be different than
    the one you use for real-time playback.
    <p>

<li><b>Real-time dither</b> - Dithering is used when converting
    high-quality samples with a lot of dynamic range, to CD-quality
    samples, with less dynamic range.  A small amount of dithering
    can make the audio sound a little bit better, but it can also
    slow down processing a little bit.  This option lets you set the
    dithering used for real-time playback.
    <p>

<li><b>High-quality dither</b> - Dithering is used when converting
    high-quality samples with a lot of dynamic range, to CD-quality
    samples, with less dynamic range.  A small amount of dithering
    can make the audio sound a little bit better, but it can also
    slow down processing a little bit.  This option lets you set the
    dithering used during Export and mixing.
    <p>

</ul>

<h2>File Formats</h2>
</font>

<ul>
<li><b>When importing uncompressed audio files into Audacity</b>

   <ul>
   <li><b>Make a copy of the file before editing (safer)</b> -
       Selecting this means that Audacity will take longer to
       import files, but it will always have its own copy of any
       audio you are using in a project.  You can move, change,
       or throw away your files immediately after you open or
       import them into Audacity.
       <p>

   <li><b>Read directly from the original file (faster)</b> -
       Selecting this means 
       that Audacity depends on your original audio files
       being there, and only stores changes you make to these
       files.  If you move, change, or throw away one of the files
       you imported into Audacity, your project may become
       unusable.  However, because Audacity doesn't need to
       make copies of everything first, it can import files
       in much less time.
       <p>
   </ul>

<li><b>Uncompressed Export Format</b> - This lets you select the
    format that Audacity will use when you export uncompressed
    files.  11 common options are displayed in the list, but you 
    can also select "Other" and choose a nonstandard file format
    for Audacity to export.
    <p>

<li><b>Ogg Export Setup</b> - Use this control to set the
    quality of Ogg Vorbis exporting.  Ogg Vorbis is a compressed
	 audio format similar to MP3, but free of patents and
	 licensing fees.  A normal quality Ogg Vorbis file is
	 encoded with a quality setting of "5".  Note that unlike
	 MP3 encoding, Ogg Vorbis does not let you set a bitrate,
	 because some audio clips are easier to compress than
	 others.  Increasing the quality will always increase the
	 file size, however.
    <p>

<li><b>MP3 Export Setup</b> - Use these controls to locate your
    MP3 encoder and set the quality of MP3 encoding.  Higher
    quality files take up more space, so you will need to find
    the level of quality you feel is the best compromise.
    For more information, see
    <a href="exportmp3.htm">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.
    <p>

</ul>

<font color="#000099">
<h2>Spectrograms</h2>
</font>

You can view any audio track as a Spectrogram instead of a
Waveform by selecting one of the Spectral views from the
<a href="menu_track.htm">Track Pop-Down Menu</a>.
This dialog lets you adjust some of the settings for these spectrograms.
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>FFT Size</b> - The size of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    affects how much vertical (frequency) detail you see.  Larger
    FFT sizes give you more bass resolution and less temporal (timing)
    resolution, and they are slower.

<li><b>Grayscale</b> - Select this for gray spectrograms instead of
    colored ones.

<li><b>Maximum Frequency</b> - Set this value anywhere from a couple
    of hundred hertz to half the sample rate (i.e. 22050 Hz if the
    sample rate is 44100 Hz).  For some applications, such as speech
    recognition or pitch extraction, very high frequencies are not
    important (visually), so this allows you to hide these and only
    focus on the ones you care about.
</ul>

<font color="#000099">
<h2>Directories</h2>
</font>

   Use this panel to set the location of Audacity's temporary
   directory (folder).  Audacity uses this directory whenever
   you work on a project that you haven't saved as an Audacity Project
   (AUP file) yet.
   You have to restart Audacity (close and open it again) for
   changes to the temporary directory to take effect.
</p>

<font color="#000099">
<h2>Interface</h2>
</font>

<ul>

<li><b>Autoscroll while playing</b> - Scrolls the window for you
    while playing, so that the playback cursor is always in the window.
    This can hurt playback performance on slower computers.
   <p>

<li><b>Always allow pausing</b> - Normally the Pause button is only
    enabled while you are playing or recording.  Checking this box
    allows you to set the pause button anytime, which allows you
    to press Record and not have the recording start until you
    unpause it.  Sometimes starting a paused recording can be faster
    than starting to record in the first place.
   <p>

<li><b>Always allow playing</b> - Normally if you press Play whilst audacity
    is playing, then nothing happens.
    Checking this box changes the behaviour so that if
    you press play whilst audacity is playing then playback is stopped and
    re-started from the same point as last time.
   <p>

<li><b>Update spectrogram while playing</b> - Because spectrograms are
    slower to draw, normally they are not drawn during playback, but this
    option lets you draw the spectrograms anyway.
   <p>

<li><b>Enable Edit Toolbar</b> - Sets whether or not you want to display
    the <a href="toolbar_edit.htm">Edit Toolbar</a>, which has some
    common shortcuts for editing commands.

<li><b>Enable Mixer Toolbar</b> - Sets whether or not you want to display
    the <a href="toolbar_mixer.htm">Mixer Toolbar</a>, which lets you
    set the volume levels and input source.

<li><b>Enable Meter Toolbar</b> - Sets whether or not you want to display
    the <a href="toolbar_meter.htm">Meter Toolbar</a>, which lets you
    monitor the input and output audio levels.

<li><b>Quit Audacity upon closing last window</b> - By default on Windows
    and X-Windows (but not Mac OS), Audacity quits when you close the
    last project window.  If you uncheck this box, Audacity will open a
    new blank document instead of quitting.  To quit Audacity in this case,
    you must specifically select Exit (or Quit) from the File menu.
   <p>

<li><b>Enable dragging of left and right selection edges</b> - Normally,
   when you move the mouse over the left and right edge of a selection,
   the cursor changes to a left or right pointer, and you can adjust
   that edge of the selection independently.  If you don't like this
   feature, uncheck this box, and then clicking will always create
   a new selection (unless you hold down Shift to extend an existing
   selection).
   <p>

<li><b>Language</b> - sets the language used by Audacity.  Language
    files are named "audacity.mo" and are found in the "Languages"
    folder on Windows and Mac OS X, or in /usr/share/locale or
    /usr/local/share/locale on most Unix systems.  Audacity will detect
    new languages the next time you start it.
   <p>
</ul>

<font color="#000099">
<h2>Keyboard</h2>
</font>

This panel lets you change keyboard shortcuts.  All of the commands
that appear in Audacity menus appear on the left, along with a few
other buttons that can get keyboard shortcuts.  To change a command,
first click on the command you want to change.  Then type the new
keyboard shortcut on your keyboard.  Verify that the correct shortcut
appears in the box below.  If it's what you want, press the <b>Set</b>
button.  Or to get rid of a keyboard shortcut, press <b>Clear</b>.
<p>
To reset to Audacity's defaults, press the <b>Defaults</b> button.
This will get rid of any changes you have made.
<p>
If you have customized your keyboard layout and want to share it
with someone else, you can press <b>Save...</b> and save your complete
keyboard layout as an XML file that you can share.  To load an existing
layout, press the <b>Load...</b> button and locate the XML file.
<p>

<font color="#000099">
<h2>Mouse</h2>
</font>

This panel doesn't let you change anything, but it lets you view
all of the commands and actions that you can do using the mouse,
many by holding down extra modifier keys.
