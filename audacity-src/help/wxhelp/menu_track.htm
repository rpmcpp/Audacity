The Track Pop-Down Menu appears when you click in a track's title.
This lets you access a few special commands that apply to individual
tracks.
<br><p>

<b>Name...</b> - lets you change the name of the track.
<br><p>

<b>Move Track Up</b> - exchange places with the track above this one.
<br><p>

<b>Move Track Down</b> - exchange places with the track below this one.
<br><p>

<b>Waveform</b> - sets the display to Waveform - this is the default way
   of visualizing audio.
<br><p>

<b>Waveform (dB)</b> - similar to Waveform, but on a logarithmic scale,
   measured in decibels (dB).
<br><p>

<b>Spectrum</b> - display the track as a spectrogram, showing the amount
   of energy in different frequency bands.
<br><p>

<b>Pitch (EAC)</b> - highlights the contour of the fundamental frequency
   (musical pitch) of the audio, using the Enhanced Autocorrelation
   (EAC) algorithm.
<br><p>

<b>Mono</b> - makes this track a mono track, meaning it is played out of
   just one speaker, or played out of the left and right speakers
   equally.
<br><p>

<b>Left Channel</b> - makes this track come out of only the left speaker.
<br><p>

<b>Right Channel</b> - makes this track come out of only the right speaker.
<br><p>

<b>Make Stereo Track</b> - if there is another track below this one,
   joins them to make a single stereo track, with the top track
   representing the left speaker, and the bottom track representing
   the right speaker.  When tracks are joined into a stereo pair,
   all edits automatically apply to both the left and right channel.
<br><p>

<b>Split Stereo Track</b> - if the selected track is a stereo track
   (a pair of left and right tracks joined together as a single track),
   this operation splits them into two separate tracks that you can
   modify and edit independently.
<br><p>
<p><b>Set Sample Format</b> - this determines the quality of the audio
   data and the amount of space it takes up. 16-bit is the quality used
   by audio CD's and is the minimum quality that Audacity uses internally
   (8-bit audio files are automatically converted when you open them). 
   24-bit is used in higher-end audio hardware. 32-bit <i>float</i> is the
   highest quality that Audacity supports, and it is recommended that you
   use 32-bit float unless you have a slow computer or are running out of
   disk space.
   </p>
   <br><p>
<b>Set Rate</b> - sets the number of samples per second of the track.
   44100 Hz is used by audio CDs.  Tracks can have different sample
   rates in Audacity; they are automatically resampled to the project
   sample rate (in the lower-left corner of the window).
