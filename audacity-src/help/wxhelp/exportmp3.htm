<h2>Exporting MP3 Files</h2>

Audacity cannot encode MP3 files by itself, because
the MP3 encoding algorithm is patented and cannot legally
be used in free programs.  However, Audacity has been
programmed to recognize other existing MP3 encoders that you
can download separately.  All you have to do is obtain the
appropriate MP3 encoder for your computer and then show
Audacity where it is located.

For links to these MP3 encoders, go to the Audacity web page
(http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) and go to the page for
your operating system.

<p>

The first time you try to export an MP3 file, Audacity
will ask you to locate your MP3 encoder.  Locate the file
indicated above.  From then on, Audacity will not
need to ask you again and you will be able to export MP3
files easily.
