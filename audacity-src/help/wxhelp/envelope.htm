Audacity lets you edit the amplitude envelope of a track directly
using the Envelope Tool:

<p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td><img src="images/tool_envelope.png" width="27" height="27"></td>
<td>Envelope tool
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>

Editing the amplitude envelope lets you change the volume of a track
gradually over time by adding a number of <b>control points</b> to
the track.  Each control point sets the amplitude (volume) at that
point in time, which can be as low as zero, and as high as 150% of the
normal maximum volume, and the volume is interpolated smoothly
between the points.

<p>

The image below shows a track with an amplitude envelope, with the
Envelope Tool selected:

<p>

In the figure above, there are five control points, at 1.0, 3.0,
5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 seconds.
Each control point has up to four "handles" arranged vertically.
The top and bottom handles are positioned at the target volume, and the
middle handles are positioned a quarter-screen down, giving you a way
to move the envelope above the 1.0 level.

<p>

Note the dotted line at the top and bottom between 5.0 and 8.0 seconds.
This indicates that the actual envelope is above the screen.  You can
see the entire contour by zooming vertically - position the cursor over
the vertical ruler to the left of the track and shift-click to zoom out.

<p>

To create a new control point, just click.  To move a point, just drag.
To remove a point, click on it and drag it outside of the track, then
let go.
