<p><b>Import Audio...</b> - 
This command is used to import audio from a standard audio format into
your project.  Use this command if you already have a couple of tracks
and you want to add another track to the same project, maybe to mix
them together.
You cannot use this option to import Audacity Projects.  The only way
to combine two Audacity Projects is to open them in separate windows,
then copy and paste the tracks.
</p>

<p><b>Import Labels...</b> - 
This command takes a text file which contains time codes and labels,
and turns them into a <a href="track_label.htm">Label Track</a>.</p>

<p><b>Import MIDI...</b> - 
This menu command imports MIDI files and puts them into a 
<a href="track_midi.htm">MIDI Track</a>.  Audacity can display
MIDI files, but <i>cannot play, edit, or save them yet.</i></p>

<p><b>Import Raw Data...</b> - 
This menu command allows you to open a file in virtually any uncompressed
format.  When you select the file,
Audacity will analyze it and try to guess its format.
It will guess correctly about 90% of the time, so you can try just
pressing "OK" and listening to the result.  If it is not correct, however,
you can use the options in the dialog to try some other possible
encodings.<br/>
At the beginning of your imported track(s), you may notice a little
bit of noise.  This is probably the file's header, which Audacity
was not able to parse.  Just zoom in and select the noise with the
<a href="toolbar_control.htm">Selection Tool</a>, and then
choose Delete from the <a href="menu_edit.htm">Edit Menu</a>.</p>

<p><b>Edit ID3 Tags...</b> - 
Opens a dialog allowing you to edit the ID3 tags associated with
a project, for MP3 exporting.</p>

<p><b>Quick Mix</b> - 
This command mixes all of the selected tracks together.  If you are
mixing stereo tracks, or mixing tracks that are marked as Left or
Right channel, the result will be a stereo track (two channels), otherwise
the result will be mono.<br/>
Your tracks are implicitly mixed whenever you hit the Play
button and whenever you export. This command offers a way to do it
permanently and save the results to disk, saving on playback resources.
<br/>
Note that if you try to mix two very loud tracks together, you may
get clipping (it will sound like pops, clicks, and noise).
To avoid this, drag the gain slider on the tracks down to reduce their
volume before mixing.</p>

<p><b>New Audio Track</b> - 
This creates a new empty
<a href="track_audio.htm">Audio Track</a>.
This command is rarely needed,
since importing, recording, and mixing automatically create new tracks
as needed.  But you can use this to cut or copy data from an existing
track and paste it into a blank track.
If that track was at a non-default rate then you may need to use Set Rate
from the <a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down</a> menu to set the correct
sample rate.
</p>

<p><b>New Stereo Track</b> - same as above, but creates a stereo track.
You can also create a stereo track by joining two tracks using the
<a href="menu_track.htm"> track pop-down menu</a>.</p>

<b>New Label Track</b> - 
This creates a new <a href="track_label.htm">Label Track</a>,
which can be very useful for textual annotation.</p>

<p><b>New Time Track</b> - 
This creates a new <a href="track_time.htm">Time Track</a>,
which is used to vary the speed of playback over time.</p>

<p><b>Remove Tracks</b> - 
This command removes the selected track or tracks from the project.
Even if only part of a track is selected, the entire track is removed.
You can also delete a track by clicking the X in its upper-left corner.
To cut out only part of the audio in a track, use
<a href="menu_edit.htm#delete">Delete</a> or 
<a href="menu_edit.htm#silence">Silence</a>.</p>

<p><b>Align Tracks...</b> - 
All the Align functions work on whole tracks or groups of tracks,
not on selections, even if they span across multiple tracks.
They all operate by time-shifting tracks (moving them left or
right), making it easier to synchronize tracks or get rid of silence
at the beginning.  The cursor or selection stays in the same place
unless you use "Align and move cursor...", below:</p>

<p><b>Align and move cursor...</b> - same as the functions above, except
that the cursor or selection is moved along with the tracks.  That
allows you to shift the tracks without losing your relative place.</p>

<p><b>Add Label at Selection</b> - 
This menu item lets you create a new label at the current selection.
You can title the label by typing with the keyboard and then hitting "Enter"
when you're done.</p>

<p><b>Add Label at Playback Position</b> - 
This menu item lets you create a new label at the current location where
you are playing or recording.  Do this if you want to mark a certain
passage while you're listening to it.  You can title the label by typing
with the keyboard and then hitting "Enter" or "Return" when you're done.
Only available whilst audacity is playing or recording.</p>
