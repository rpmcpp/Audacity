<b>Set Selection Format</b> - lets you choose the formatting that is

or pure time.  If you turn on Snap-To mode in the
<a href="menu_edit.htm">Edit Menu</a>, the selection will snap to the
frames or other quantization you have selected in this menu.
<br><p>

<b>History...</b> - Brings up the history window.
It shows all the actions you have performed during the current session,
including importing.  The right-hand column shows the amount of hard disk
space your operations used.  You can jump back and forth between editing
steps quite easily by simply clicking on the entries in the window, the
same as selecting Undo or Redo many times in a row.  You can also discard
Undo history to save disk space.
The history window can be kept open while you work.
