<h1>Sound File Formats</h1>

<h2>Audacity Project format (AUP)</h2>
</font>

Audacity projects are stored in an AUP file, which is a format that
has been highly optimized for Audacity so that it can open and save
projects quickly.  In order to achieve this speed, Audacity
breaks larger audio files into several smaller pieces and stores these
pieces in a directory with a similar name as the project.
For example, if you name a project "chanson", then Audacity will create a
project file called <tt>chanson.aup</tt> to store the general
information about your project, and it will store your audio in several
files inside a directory called <tt>chanson_data</tt>.
While the Audacity Project format is based on XML and is meant to be
open, it is not currently compatible with any other audio
programs, so when you are finished working on a project and you
want to be able to edit the audio in another program, select
Export from the <a href="menu_file.htm">File Menu</a>.

<h2>WAV (Windows Wave format)</h2>
</font>

This is the default uncompressed audio format on Windows, and is supported
on almost all computer systems.  Audacity can read and write this format.
People working with multichannel audio at very high quality settings, or with
very long recordings, should note that the maximum size of a wav file is
2GB.<p>

<font color="#000099">
<h2>AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)</h2>
</font>

This is the default uncompressed audio format on the Macintosh, and it
is supported by most computer systems, but it is not quite as common as
the WAV format.  Audacity can read and write this format.

<font color="#000099">
<h2>Sun Au / NeXT</h2>
</font>
This is the default audio format on Sun and NeXT computers, and
usually u-law compressed, so it is not a very high quality
format.  U-law compression is a very simple, fast but low quality way to reduce the size of the audio by about 50%. This format was one of the first audio
formats supported by
Web browsers, and it is still often used for short sound effects where
quality is not as important.<br/>
Audacity exports both 8-bit u-law files, and 16-bit uncompressed files, which
are the same quality as wav or aiff files.

<h2>MP3 (MPEG I, Layer 3)</h2>
</font>

This is a compressed audio format that is a very popular way to
store music.  It can compress audio by a factor of 10:1 with very
little degradation in quality.  Audacity can both import and export
this format.  For more information on how to export MP3 files from
within Audacity, see <a href="exportmp3.htm">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.

<font color="#000099">
<h2>Ogg Vorbis</h2>
</font>

This compressed audio format was designed to be a free
alternative to MP3.  Ogg Vorbis files are not as common, but
they are about the same size as MP3 with better quality to rival
AAC or WMA.  Audacity can import and export this format.
