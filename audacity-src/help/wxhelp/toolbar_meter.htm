The Meter Toolbar is used for monitoring the input and output audio
levels.  Typically it is used to make sure that the loudest volume
is as loud as possible (for maximum fidelity) without clipping or 
distorting it.
The output (playback) meter is the green one, on the left pictured
above, and the input (recording) meter is in red, on the right.
<br>
It toolbar provides a visual indication of the current audio levels going
in and out of audacity.
<p>

If you float the Meter Toolbar, either by dragging it out of the toolbar
or by selecting "Float Meter Toolbar" from the View menu, you can resize it
and even orient it vertically.

<p>

Normally the meters are only active when you are playing or recording audio.
However, you can also monitor input when you're not recording - to do this,
either select "Monitor Input" from the input meter's pop-up menu, or else
just click on the input meter.  If you have a microphone or other input
source attached, you will be able to watch the level of the audio before
you start recording.

<p>

Each meter shows several characteristics of the audio level at once:
<ul>
	<li>The right hand end of the meter corresponds to the point at
	which the audio will be clipped, and the left hand end is silence</li>
	<li>For stereo, the top bar shows the left channel, and the bottom
	bar shows the right channel.</li>
	<li>The brightest part of the bar shows the average audio
	level (related to the loudness) and the darker part of the 
	bar shows the peak audio level.</li>
	<li>The peak-hold line to the right of this shows the maximum
	audio level achieved in the last 3 seconds.</li>
	<li>Finally, the clipping indicators on the far right of
	each meter will light up if clipping is detected (meaning that
	the audio was too loud and will sound distorted).</li></ul>
<p>
If clipping is detected when you are recording, you should stop, lower
the volume of your input source, and start recording again from the start.
If the output meter clips then you need to make some or all of your tracks
quieter using the track <a href="track_audio.htm">gain control</a>.
<br>
If the level of the input (recording) source is too high, you can try
to lower the input level using the <a href="toolbar_mixer.htm">Mixer
Toolbar</a>, but if this doesn't work, you should try to lower the volume
of the external input source (e.g., your microphone, cassette player, or
record player).

<p>

It is possible, especially if you have an older, slower computer, that
the Meter Toolbar may interfere with Audacity's ability to record or play
audio with the highest quality, because your computer is so busy redrawing
the meters that it doesn't have time to process enough audio.  In this is the
case for you, you can disable the Meter Toolbar in the Interface tab of
the <a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a> dialog.
