This is a binary package of Audacity for i386 Linux.  It should run
on most recent Linux systems running on an Intel x86-compatible
processor; all it requires is glibc 2.2 and gtk+ 1.2.  If it does
not run on your system, please notify the Audacity developers
<audacity-help@lists.sourceforge.net>, and in the meantime you will
have to compile Audacity from source.

You can run Audacity directly out of this directory by typing:

  ./audacity

To install Audacity in /usr/local, just run "make install" as a
privileged user, for example:

  sudo make install

To install to a different directory, edit the PREFIX line near
the top of the Makefile first.
