    * src/src_sinc.c
    Phase one or refactoring. Replace use of a circular buffer to hold short
    window of data with a linear buffer.
    Linear buffer requires that data is periodically copied from the end if
    the buffer back to the beginning. However, it also means that the
    calc_output() function no longer needs to calculate the next data index
    modulo the buffer length.
    Since the data index is calculated 40 times (minimum) per output sample,
    and the copy from end of buffer to start of buffer is done every 1000 or
    so output samples, this change results in a significant speedup (up to
    about 50% improvement for SRC_SINC_FASTEST).
    Memory use has increased somewhat (max 6k per channel per converter) due
    to this fix, but that should go down again during next phase of
    refactoring.

    * examples/varispeed-play.c
    Fixed a bug where data_in and data_out buffers were overlapping.

    * src/high_qual_coeffs.h
    Conrad Parker found a file which produced clicking when run thru the
    SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY filter. Recalculated the filter with slightly less
    stringent design parameters and fixed the problem. The band with of the
    new filter is 96.6% while the old one was a little ober 97%.

2002-11-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * All files.
    libsamplerate is working. There have been a couple of private releases
    for people to test but no public release.
