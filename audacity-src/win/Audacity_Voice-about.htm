		<center><h1>About Audacity_Voice</h1>
		</center>
		<p>
			<b>Audacity_Voice</b> is a free, customised version of <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">
				<b>Audacity 1.2.6</b></a>. It enhances the voice-recording capabilities for 
			users of <b>Audiotouch</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Audiotouch</b> is a voice recording program which reduces user keystroke 
			inputs to the minimum. <b>Audacity_Voice</b> also minimises keystrokes for 
			the saving of edited files.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Audacity_Voice</b> is made possible by the entire Audacity Team. 
			Specific mods for this version of Audacity were made by Vaughan Johnson. 
			Students of the World, with a microphone in hand, whose computing experiences 
			are enlivened by voice recordings, will no doubt join me in expressing 
			gratitude to these guys!
